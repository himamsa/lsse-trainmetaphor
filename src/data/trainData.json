The default experience today is that anyone joining your Personal Room can jump into your meeting right away, without having to wait in the lobby. With this update, we're making your Personal Room meetings more secure. Guests who try to join your Personal Room automatically wait in your lobby until you admit them. In conjunction with these security changes, we\u2019re also making changes to enhance the management of users in the lobby and in the meeting itself.",

Click on the pop-out icon to float the panel in its own window. Once floating, you can pop the panel back into the meeting window at any time, and it snaps right back into place.

In this update, this dictionary is limited to 100 words and English language support only.",
      "The new lobby controls for Personal Room meetings re-categorizes guest users, separating them into two groups with separate lobby controls.
